TriHealth is an all-in-one platform designed around the idea of promoting mindful habits. The app provides tools for tracking food intake, sleep, exercise, and mood, with the goal of reinforcing positive, attainable habits. 

This platform is designed primarily for busy high school/college students who often forego their pyhsical and mental health due to the demands of academic life, work, and social commitments. The ultimate goal is to try and make the user a  better person than they were yesterday. 

## Features
- Food Tracker: Log meals and snacks to keep track of calorie and overall nutrient intake 
- Body Tracker: Track goals related to body health, such as exercise, steps, and hours of sleep
- Mind Tracker: Stay on top of mental health with goals such as journaling, meditation, and mood tracking
- Habit Adjustment: The app tries to strike a balance between making goals attainable and not too difficult, but user adjustment and freedom to choose goals should always be an option

## Getting Started 
- Upon creating an account, the user will be asked which areas of health and mindfulness they want to focus on 
- The user will then be asked if they want to share health data 
- These two combined will create a matrix of weights, from which their key performance indicators(KPIs) will be generated along with a set of starting goals 
- The user will then have the option to adjust goals if they don't like them 
-The app is designed to be user-friendly and intuitive, with easy-to-use tools and helpful tips to guide you along the way :)
